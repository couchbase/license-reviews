PROPRIETARY ASSET TEMPLATE
==========================



Template Description:

A company has developed a component that is of great value to one highly
profitable product line and that would also be very useful in the development of
other products. The availability of the source code of the component to any other
software company could enable competition with the highly profitable product
line. Thus, the terms under which another product would use the component would
permit use and modification of the component, but would prohibit shipment of
source code to any customer, including to an OEM partner for the second product.
